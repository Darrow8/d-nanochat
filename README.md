# D-NanoChat


## Day 1

The ambition of this project is to replicate [nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat) without using AI, as Andrej Karpathy recommended in an [interview](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy) with Dwarkesh Patel. 

I may also add some additional specs if I find interesting improvements along the way. 

I have experience in machine learning and implementing software projects, but I think this is going to be challenge as I have little experience with rust.  

I asked ChatGPT to generate a set of milestones for implementing nanochat which are saved in PLAN.md. 

Ok looks like I've installed the requisite packages and `uv sync` works. 

I am starting by working through the rustbpe code.
